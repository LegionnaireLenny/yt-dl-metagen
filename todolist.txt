Bug:
	Fix the fucking scrollbar
	Typing text while focused on window but not on url bar messes up url
		crashes on fetching another playlist
	
Improvement:
	Improve logging
		Better messages
		Direct logging to window within program or bring up another window for messages
	Load mutliple playlists and display in tabbed/page layout
		url fetcher spawns popups that keep track of their own lists and download progress?
	Parallel downloads
	cache the fetched url and use the cached version when ripping instead of pulling the text from the url text input
